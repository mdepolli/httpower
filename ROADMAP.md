- ‚úÖ Three states: closed, open, half-open
- ‚úÖ Configurable failure thresholds (absolute and percentage)
- ‚úÖ Sliding window for request tracking
- ‚úÖ Half-open state with limited test requests
- ‚úÖ Automatic state transitions based on success/failure
- ‚úÖ Manual circuit control (open, close, reset)
- ‚úÖ Per-client and per-endpoint circuit breaker keys
- ‚úÖ Works seamlessly with existing retry logic

## Phase 2: Advanced Features üîÆ

  - Track circuit breaker state changes
  - Monitor rate limiter consumption
  - Request/response timing metrics
  - Integration with existing observability tools

**Priority 3: Smart Rate Limiting**

- [ ] **Rate limit headers parsing** - Automatic detection from server responses
  - Support X-RateLimit-*, RateLimit-*, Retry-After headers
  - Dynamic rate limit adjustment based on server responses
  - Rate limit quota tracking and reporting
  - Automatic backoff when server indicates limits

**Priority 4: Circuit Breaker Enhancements**

- [ ] **Circuit state notifications/callbacks** - Enable alerting and monitoring
  - Callbacks for state transitions (closed ‚Üí open, etc.)
  - Configurable notification handlers
  - Integration with monitoring systems

**Priority 5: Developer Experience**

- [ ] **Automatic pagination handling** - Simplify paginated API consumption
  - Common pagination patterns (offset, cursor, page number)
  - Lazy enumeration of all pages
  - Configurable page size and limits
  - Works with existing retry and rate limiting

**Future Enhancements**

- [ ] Request/response middleware pipeline
- [ ] Pre/post request hooks
- [ ] Response validation helpers
- [ ] Bulk operation batching

## Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration üåê

**Authentication & Caching**

- [ ] OAuth 2.0 token management with automatic refresh
- [ ] Response caching (memory/Redis)
  - Cache-Control header respect
  - ETags and conditional requests
  - Configurable cache backends

**Monitoring & Metrics**

- [ ] Prometheus metrics export
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Performance benchmarking tools
- [ ] Request/response size tracking

## Design Principles

1. **Production First**: Every feature must be production-ready with comprehensive tests
2. **Adapter-Based**: Support multiple HTTP clients (Req, Tesla) through adapter pattern, ensuring production features work consistently across all adapters
3. **Zero-Config Sensible Defaults**: Work great out of the box with Req adapter, configure when needed
4. **Elixir Idiomatic**: Use proper Elixir patterns (GenServer, supervision, etc.)
5. **Never Break**: Comprehensive backward compatibility and smooth upgrades
6. **PCI Compliance**: Built-in security features for payment processing ‚úÖ

## Target Use Cases

- **Payment Processing**: PCI-compliant HTTP client for payment gateways
- **API Integration**: Reliable client for third-party API consumption
- **Microservices**: Inter-service communication with reliability patterns
- **High-Volume APIs**: Rate limiting and circuit breaking for scale
- **Financial Services**: Compliance and audit logging capabilities

## Success Metrics

- **Reliability**: 99.9%+ success rate for well-formed requests
- **Performance**: <10ms overhead over raw Req for simple requests
- **Adoption**: Used by 100+ Elixir applications in production
- **Documentation**: Complete guides for all major use cases
- **Community**: Active contributor community and ecosystem
