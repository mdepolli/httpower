# HTTPower Roadmap

A reliable HTTP client that wraps Req with advanced features for production applications.

## Current Status ‚úÖ

**Core Foundation (v0.1.0)**

- ‚úÖ Basic HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- ‚úÖ Test mode request blocking with Req.Test integration
- ‚úÖ Smart retry logic with configurable policies
- ‚úÖ Clean error handling (never raises exceptions)
- ‚úÖ SSL/Proxy configuration support
- ‚úÖ Request timeout management
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite (100% coverage)

## Phase 1: Production Reliability üöß

**Logging & Debugging Features**

- [ ] HTTP request/response logging for debugging
- [ ] Sanitized logging that scrubs sensitive data (PCI compliance)
- [ ] Request timing and performance metrics
- [ ] Configurable log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- [ ] Request/response ID correlation for tracing

**Rate Limiting**

- [ ] Built-in rate limiting to respect API limits
- [ ] Per-endpoint rate limit configuration
- [ ] Token bucket algorithm implementation
- [ ] Rate limit headers parsing and respect
- [ ] Automatic backoff when limits are hit

**Circuit Breaker Pattern**

- [ ] Circuit breaker for failing services
- [ ] Configurable failure thresholds
- [ ] Half-open state for health checks
- [ ] Exponential backoff with jitter for retries
- [ ] Circuit state notifications/callbacks

## Phase 2: Advanced Features üîÆ

**Performance & Reliability**

- [ ] Connection pooling optimization
- [ ] HTTP/2 support
- [ ] Keep-alive connection management
- [ ] Request deduplication
- [ ] Response compression handling

**Security & Compliance**

- [ ] Request/response sanitization
- [ ] PCI DSS compliance features
- [ ] Audit logging capabilities
- [ ] Request signature verification
- [ ] HMAC authentication helpers

**Developer Experience**

- [ ] Request/response middleware pipeline
- [ ] Pre/post request hooks
- [ ] Request transformation utilities
- [ ] Response validation helpers
- [ ] Mock server integration for testing

## Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration üåê

**Advanced Authentication**

- [ ] OAuth 2.0 token management with automatic refresh
- [ ] API key rotation and management
- [ ] JWT token handling and validation
- [ ] Multi-tenant authentication patterns

**Monitoring & Observability**

- [ ] Telemetry integration (OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] Prometheus metrics export
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Request tracing and spans
- [ ] Performance benchmarking tools

**Advanced Patterns**

- [ ] Response caching (memory/Redis)
- [ ] Request streaming for large payloads
- [ ] Automatic pagination handling
- [ ] Bulk operation batching
- [ ] Webhook verification utilities

## Design Principles

1. **Production First**: Every feature must be production-ready with comprehensive tests
2. **Req-Based**: Leverage Req's excellent foundation while adding advanced features
3. **Zero-Config Sensible Defaults**: Work great out of the box, configure when needed
4. **Elixir Idiomatic**: Use proper Elixir patterns (GenServer, supervision, etc.)
5. **Never Break**: Comprehensive backward compatibility and smooth upgrades
6. **PCI Compliance**: Built-in security features for payment processing

## Target Use Cases

- **Payment Processing**: PCI-compliant HTTP client for payment gateways
- **API Integration**: Reliable client for third-party API consumption
- **Microservices**: Inter-service communication with reliability patterns
- **High-Volume APIs**: Rate limiting and circuit breaking for scale
- **Financial Services**: Compliance and audit logging capabilities

## Success Metrics

- **Reliability**: 99.9%+ success rate for well-formed requests
- **Performance**: <10ms overhead over raw Req for simple requests
- **Adoption**: Used by 100+ Elixir applications in production
- **Documentation**: Complete guides for all major use cases
- **Community**: Active contributor community and ecosystem
