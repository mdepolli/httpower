## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2025-09-30

### Added

- **Adapter pattern** supporting multiple HTTP clients (Req and Tesla)
- `HTTPower.Adapter` behavior for implementing custom adapters
- `HTTPower.Adapter.Req` - adapter using Req HTTP client
- `HTTPower.Adapter.Tesla` - adapter for existing Tesla users
- **`HTTPower.Test`** - adapter-agnostic testing module with zero external dependencies
  - `HTTPower.Test.setup/0` - enables mocking for current test
  - `HTTPower.Test.stub/1` - registers stub function to handle requests
  - `HTTPower.Test.json/2`, `html/2`, `text/2` - response helpers
  - `HTTPower.Test.transport_error/2` - simulates network failures (timeout, connection errors, etc.)
- `HTTPower.TestInterceptor` - clean separation of test logic from production code using compile-time checks
- Comprehensive test suite proving adapter independence (50 tests total)
- `adapter` option for specifying which adapter to use
- **Smart adapter detection** - automatically uses available adapter (Req preferred if both present)
- Both Req and Tesla are now optional dependencies - choose the one you need
- Example files moved to `docs/` directory

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Fixed double retry bug where Req's built-in retry ran alongside HTTPower's retry
- **Critical**: Fixed double error wrapping where `HTTPower.Error` structs were wrapped multiple times
- Req adapter now explicitly sets `retry: false` to disable Req's retry mechanism
- Retry logic now runs consistently once per request attempt
- Error handling now checks if errors are already wrapped before wrapping again

### Changed

- Internal architecture refactored to use adapter pattern (public API unchanged)
- `HTTPower.Client` now routes requests through adapters instead of calling Req directly
- Design principle updated from "Req-Based" to "Adapter-Based"
- Documentation updated to emphasize adapter flexibility and production features
- Refactored control flow to eliminate nested conditionals (removed `if` inside `with`, `case` inside `if`)
- Main test suite now uses `HTTPower.Test` instead of `Req.Test` for true adapter independence

### Technical Details

- Adapter abstraction allows production features (retry, circuit breaker, rate limiting) to work consistently across HTTP clients
- **Symmetric dependencies**: Both Req and Tesla are optional - install only what you need
- Smart adapter detection automatically selects available adapter (prefers Req if both present)
- Backward compatible: existing code continues to work (Req auto-detected if installed)
- Tesla users can now adopt HTTPower without pulling in Req dependency
- Clear error message if neither adapter is installed
- Test-mode blocking works seamlessly across both adapters
- All 50 tests passing (29 main + 9 Req adapter + 9 Tesla adapter + 3 transport error tests)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-09

### Added

- Client configuration with `HTTPower.new/1` for reusable HTTP clients
- Base URL support for configured clients with automatic path resolution
- Option merging between client defaults and per-request settings
- Support for all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with client instances
- Comprehensive test coverage for client configuration functionality
- HTTP status code retry logic following industry standards (408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504)
- Exponential backoff with jitter for intelligent retry timing
- Configurable retry parameters: `base_delay`, `max_delay`, `jitter_factor`
- Fast unit tests for retry decision logic separated from execution

### Improved

- Retry test suite performance improved by 70% (48s â†’ 15s) through separation of concerns
- Refactored retry decision functions for better testability and maintainability

### Fixed

- Corrected changelog to accurately reflect implemented vs planned features
- Updated documentation to clarify current capabilities

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-09

### Added

- Basic HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with clean API
- Test mode request blocking to prevent real HTTP requests during testing
- Req.Test integration for controlled HTTP testing and mocking
- Smart retry logic with configurable policies and error categorization
- Clean error handling that never raises exceptions
- SSL certificate verification with configurable options
- Proxy configuration support (system proxy and custom proxy settings)
- Request timeout management with sensible defaults
- Comprehensive error messages for common network issues
- Support for custom headers and request bodies
- Automatic Content-Type headers for POST requests
- Connection close headers for reliable request handling
- Mint.TransportError handling for detailed network error reporting
- Complete test suite with 100% coverage
- Full documentation with examples and API reference
- Hex package configuration for easy installation

### Technical Details

- Built on top of Req HTTP client for reliability
- Uses Mint for low-level HTTP transport (via Req)
- Supports HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocols
- Elixir 1.14+ compatibility
- Production-ready error handling and logging
- PCI DSS compliance considerations in design
