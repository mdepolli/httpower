# HTTPower Roadmap

A reliable HTTP client that wraps Req with advanced features for production applications.

## Current Status ✅

**Core Foundation (v0.1.0 - v0.3.0)**

- ✅ Basic HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- ✅ Adapter pattern supporting Req and Tesla HTTP clients
- ✅ Test mode request blocking with Req.Test integration
- ✅ Smart retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter
- ✅ HTTP status code retry logic (408, 429, 500-504)
- ✅ Clean error handling (never raises exceptions)
- ✅ SSL/Proxy configuration support
- ✅ Request timeout management
- ✅ Client configuration pattern with reusable configs
- ✅ PCI-compliant request/response logging with automatic sanitization
- ✅ Request correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- ✅ Request timing and duration tracking
- ✅ Built-in rate limiting with token bucket algorithm
- ✅ Per-endpoint and per-client rate limit configuration
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (115 tests, 67%+ coverage)

## Phase 1: Production Reliability 🚧

**Logging & Debugging Features** ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ HTTP request/response logging for debugging
- ✅ Sanitized logging that scrubs sensitive data (PCI compliance)
- ✅ Request timing and performance metrics (duration tracking)
- ✅ Configurable log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- ✅ Request/response ID correlation for tracing (correlation IDs)
- ✅ Automatic sanitization of credit cards, CVV, passwords, API keys, auth tokens
- ✅ Configurable sanitization rules (custom headers and body fields)

**Rate Limiting** ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Built-in rate limiting to respect API limits
- ✅ Per-endpoint rate limit configuration
- ✅ Token bucket algorithm implementation
- ✅ Two strategies: wait (with timeout) or error
- ✅ ETS-based storage for high performance
- ✅ Custom bucket keys for flexible grouping
- [ ] Rate limit headers parsing and respect (Future)
- [ ] Automatic backoff when limits are hit (Already implemented via strategy)

**Circuit Breaker Pattern**

- [ ] Circuit breaker for failing services
- [ ] Configurable failure thresholds
- [ ] Half-open state for health checks
- ✅ Exponential backoff with jitter for retries (already implemented)
- [ ] Circuit state notifications/callbacks

## Phase 2: Advanced Features 🔮

**Performance & Reliability**

- [ ] Connection pooling optimization
- [ ] HTTP/2 support
- [ ] Keep-alive connection management
- [ ] Request deduplication
- [ ] Response compression handling

**Security & Compliance**

- ✅ Request/response sanitization (PCI-compliant logging)
- ✅ PCI DSS compliance features (automatic data redaction)
- ✅ Audit logging capabilities (correlation IDs + timing)
- [ ] Request signature verification
- [ ] HMAC authentication helpers

**Developer Experience**

- [ ] Request/response middleware pipeline
- [ ] Pre/post request hooks
- [ ] Request transformation utilities
- [ ] Response validation helpers
- [ ] Mock server integration for testing

## Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration 🌐

**Advanced Authentication**

- [ ] OAuth 2.0 token management with automatic refresh
- [ ] API key rotation and management
- [ ] JWT token handling and validation
- [ ] Multi-tenant authentication patterns

**Monitoring & Observability**

- [ ] Telemetry integration (OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] Prometheus metrics export
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Request tracing and spans
- [ ] Performance benchmarking tools

**Advanced Patterns**

- [ ] Response caching (memory/Redis)
- [ ] Request streaming for large payloads
- [ ] Automatic pagination handling
- [ ] Bulk operation batching
- [ ] Webhook verification utilities

## Version History

**v0.3.0** (Current)
- Added PCI-compliant request/response logging with automatic sanitization
- Implemented correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- Added request duration tracking and performance metrics
- Configurable sanitization rules for headers and body fields

**v0.2.0**
- Implemented client configuration pattern with `HTTPower.new/1`
- Added HTTP status code retry logic (408, 429, 500-504)
- Implemented exponential backoff with jitter
- Improved retry test performance by 70%

**v0.1.0**
- Initial release with basic HTTP methods
- Test mode blocking with Req.Test integration
- Smart retry logic and error handling
- SSL/Proxy configuration support

## Design Principles

1. **Production First**: Every feature must be production-ready with comprehensive tests
2. **Adapter-Based**: Support multiple HTTP clients (Req, Tesla) through adapter pattern, ensuring production features work consistently across all adapters
3. **Zero-Config Sensible Defaults**: Work great out of the box with Req adapter, configure when needed
4. **Elixir Idiomatic**: Use proper Elixir patterns (GenServer, supervision, etc.)
5. **Never Break**: Comprehensive backward compatibility and smooth upgrades
6. **PCI Compliance**: Built-in security features for payment processing ✅

## Target Use Cases

- **Payment Processing**: PCI-compliant HTTP client for payment gateways
- **API Integration**: Reliable client for third-party API consumption
- **Microservices**: Inter-service communication with reliability patterns
- **High-Volume APIs**: Rate limiting and circuit breaking for scale
- **Financial Services**: Compliance and audit logging capabilities

## Success Metrics

- **Reliability**: 99.9%+ success rate for well-formed requests
- **Performance**: <10ms overhead over raw Req for simple requests
- **Adoption**: Used by 100+ Elixir applications in production
- **Documentation**: Complete guides for all major use cases
- **Community**: Active contributor community and ecosystem
